# Synopsis

This repository contains Deep Learning code to understand DL concepts like CNN, R-CNN, GANs etc. 
Most of these algorithms are accompanied with blog-posts (http://ataspinar.com) and notebooks (see below) in which I try to explain it in more detail. 


# Notebooks
+ [1. Building Convolutional Neural Networks in Tensorflow](https://github.com/taspinar/sidl/blob/master/notebooks/1_Building_CNN_Models_in_Tensorflow.ipynb)
+ [2. Using Convolutional Neural Networks to detect roads in sattelite images](https://github.com/taspinar/sidl/blob/master/notebooks/2_Detecting_road_and_roadtypes_in_sattelite_images.ipynb)
